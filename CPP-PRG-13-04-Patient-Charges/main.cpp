//  Write a class named Patient that has member variablrs for the following data:
//
//  * First name, middle name, last name
//  * Address, city, state, and ZIP code
//  * Phone number
//  * Name and phone number of emergency contact
//
//  The Patient class should have a constructor that accepts an argument for each member
//  variable. The Patient class should also have accessor and mutator functions for
//  each member variable.
//
//  Next, write a class named Procedure that represents a medical procedure that has
//  been performed on a patient. The Procedure class should have member variables for
//  the following data:
//
//  * Name of the procedure
//  * Date of the procedure
//  * Name of the practitioner who performed the procedure
//  * Charges for the procedure
//
//  The Procedure class should have a constructor that accepts an argument for each
//  member variable. The Procedure class should also have accessor and mutator functions
//  for each member variable.
//
//  Next, write a program that creates an instance of the Patient class, intialized with
//  sample data. Then, create three instances of the Procedure class, initialized with the
//  following data:
//
//  Procedure #1:                   Procedure #2:                   Procedure #3:
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Procedure name: Physical Exam   Procedure Name: X-ray           Procedure name: Blood test
//  Date: Today's date              Date: Today's date              Date: Today's date
//  Practitioner: Dr. Irvine        Practitioner: Dr. Jamison       Practitioner: Dr. Smith
//  Charge: 250.00                  Charge: 500.00                  Charge: 200.00
//
//  The program should display the patient's information, information about all three of
//  the procedures, and the total charges of the three procedures.
